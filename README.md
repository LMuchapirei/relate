Implement Core Features
  1. Relationship Management:
    Use a Firestore collection to store relationship details.
    Each document would store data such as:
    Name
    Contact Information
    Interaction frequency
    Avatar or profile picture
    Last contact date

3. Scheduling Reminders:
    Use DateTime and Firebase Functions or local notifications to schedule reminders.
    Let the user set frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) for calls or interactions.

4. Push Notifications:
    Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send reminders.
    Show a notification with options like "Call Now" or "Snooze" when the reminder time approaches.

5. Post-Interaction Summary:
    After a call is completed, open a summary screen.
    Allow the user to input:
    How they felt: (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).
    Notes: (e.g., topics discussed, future plans).
    Save the data to Firestore for that specific relationship.
6. Interaction History:
    Display a history of all interactions, with filters for date and type of interaction.
    Let users review their emotional trends and patterns over time.
